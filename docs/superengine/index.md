## What is SuperEngine

SuperEngine is a Calypso Engine that embeds an enterprise level ESB ([Mule](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb)).

## What can it do?

Simply put, anything that Mule can do, SuperEngine can do. The actions and events processed by the engine can then be converted into ps_events that Calypso can then consume.
