A tool to assist with the addition of a Calypso release into a Maven repository. This will be useful if you already have a Maven based Calypso build system and you are looking to quickly get all the release files into your repository quickly.

It will help with the extraction and deployment of jars from the main Calypso release into your Maven repository by means of creating a script based on the Calypso release jar. It will also create the dependency fragments for the pom file.
