## What is the calypso-maven-plugin

This is a general purpose Maven plugin to help with the development of any [Calypso](http://www.calypso.com) related project.

## How can it help?

There are two main areas to the plugin

* a plugin - This is used to add various functions to the build and works in tandem with the Maven lifecycle just like any other plugin
* an archetype - This offers a way to logically organize your project, build your release components and build and deploy your production code.
